### Core Concept
* There are many ways to deploy a SaaS solution. Compliance, isolation, noisy neighbor, tiering and other considerations can have lead you to deploy your SaaS offering in any number of different deployment patterns that best align with the business and operational goals of your SaaS environment. These deployment models are not mutually exclusive. Some SaaS businesses may opt to support multiple deployment models to address the specific and personas of their customer base.


### Why It Matters
* Picking the deployment model of your SaaS application represents one of the most fundamental decisions you’ll need to make for your SaaS offering. You’ll need to weigh a variety of business and technical factors, determining which mix of customer, market, and technical considerations will shape the deployment model ultimately select. This decision will also have a direct impact on the operational efficiency, agility, and overall success of the SaaS offering.
### When Should I be Thinking About This?
* Figuring out your deployment model is one of the most early and foundational elements of building your overall SaaS business and technical footprint. You upfront process should be looking at tiering, isolation, noisy neighbor, and customer tiering profiles to determine which deployment models are best aligned to the needs of your business.
### What Are The Typical Deployment Patterns?
* Generally deployment appears in three distinct patterns, including full stack silo, full stack pool, and bridge deployment models. The basic idea here is that we’re picking a deployment model that determines the degree to which tenants will be sharing resources. A full stack silo, for example, has all resources of a tenant running in a separate infrastructure. Full stack pool is the polar opposite of this model, sharing all resources for all tenants. The bridge model allows for middle ground where some resources may be siloed and some may be pooled. All three of these patterns still rely on a common control plane that manages and operates all tenants through a shared experience.
