## How to Publish a Pattern

To submit a new saas builder pattern, or to make changes to existing code, follow the instructions below. Note: I can take up to 24 hours for a new pattern to appear after a pull request is accepted.

## Repo Names

* **local:** Your local copy of the forked repository.
* **origin:** Your forked, remote copy of the original repository.
* **upstream:** The original, remote saasbuilder-patterns repository.

## Initial Setup

[Fork and Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the saasbuilder-patterns repo.

1. Fork the original saasbuilder-patterns repo to create a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account: https://github.com/aws-samples/saasbuilder-patterns
1. Clone your copy of the repo to download it locally: `git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/saasbuilder-patterns.git`
1. Change into the new local directory: `cd saasbuilder-patterns`
1. Add the original saasbuilder-patterns repo as another remote repo called "upstream": `git remote add upstream https://github.com/aws-samples/saasbuilder-patterns`
1. For verification, display the remote repos: `git remote -v`

   The output should look like this:

    ```
	origin  https://github.com/{your-github-username}/saasbuilder-patterns.git (fetch)
	origin  https://github.com/{your-github-username}/saasbuilder-patterns.git (push)
	upstream        https://github.com/aws-samples/saasbuilder-patterns (fetch)
	upstream        https://github.com/aws-samples/saasbuilder-patterns (push)
	```

## Create Branch

Create a new local branch for each saas pattern or modification being made. This allows you to create separate pull requests in the upstream repo.

1. Create and checkout a new local branch before making code changes: `git checkout -b {branch-name}`

   Branch name syntax: `{username}-{pattern|fix}-{description}`

   Example branch name: `myusername-silo-security-saasbuilder`

1. For verification, display all branches: `git branch -a`

   The output should look like this:

    ```
    * {branch-name}
    main
    remotes/origin/HEAD â†’ origin/main
    remotes/origin/main
    ```

## Your Pattern

Now is the time to create your new saas pattern or modify an existing pattern.

1. If you are creating a new saas pattern, copy the folder named "_pattern-template" to start with a template: `cp -r _pattern-template {new-folder-name}`
2. If you are modifying an existing pattern, make your code changes now.
3. Update the authors.json file complete with all authors of this pattern
4. Update the patterns.json file in the repositories root directory and include your new pattern in the correct location as a new root or child of another pattern. Create a new UUID for your new patterns id and make sure it is not used by any other existing pattern.
5. You can test the format of your layout [here](https://main.d64uo5pr4i9km.amplifyapp.com/#/Preview) to validate the patterns markdown. Use the full URL to your github pattern folder for  [example](https://main.d64uo5pr4i9km.amplifyapp.com/#/Preview?pattern=https://github.com/aws-samples/saasbuilder-patterns/tree/main/FullStackSilo).
6. When your pattern is complete, stage the changes to your local branch: `git add .`
7. Commit the changes to your local branch: `git commit -m 'Comment here'`

## Pull Request

Push your code to the remote repos and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

1. Push the local branch to the remote origin repo: `git push origin {branch-name}`

   If this is the first push to the remote origin repo, you will be asked to Connect to GitHub to authorize the connection. Sometimes the pop-up window appears behind other windows.

1. Go to the [upstream repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/saasbuilder-patterns) in Github and click "Compare & pull request".
    1. Enter an appropriate title including path the pattern should appear under:

       Example title: `New pattern submission - Under - Deployment Models\Full Stack Silo Deployment\Silo Security`

    1. Add a short description of the pattern.
    1. Click "Create pull request".
1. Submit a [new issue](https://github.com/aws-samples/saasbuilder-patterns/issues/new?assignees=swarwick&labels=&template=new-saas-pattern-submission.md&title=New+pattern+submission+-+Under+-+{Pattern\Path}) or use an existing issue to provide the additional details that will be used to build the saas pattern on SaaSBuilder.com.
   1. Add a link to the pull request in the "GitHub PR for template" section. If you type a hashtag (#), it will display a list of the current pull requests to select from. 
   2. Click "Submit new issue" (Or update an existing issue). 
   3. Example issue: https://github.com/aws-samples/saasbuilder-patterns/issues/1

## Sync Repos

After your pull request has been accepted into the upstream repo:

1. Switch to your local main branch: `git checkout main`
1. Pull changes that occurred in the upstream repo: `git fetch upstream`
1. Merge the upstream main branch with your local main branch: `git merge upstream/main main`
1. Push changes from you local repo to the remote origin repo: `git push origin main`

## Delete Branches

Delete any unnecessary local and origin branches.

1. Switch to your local main branch: `git checkout main`
1. For verification, display all branches: `git branch -a`
1. Delete any unnecessary local branches: `git branch -d {branch-name}`
1. Delete any unnecessary remote origin branches: `git push origin --delete {branch-name}`

## Helpful Tips

1. When creating a pattern.md file for your saas pattern, place example code and commands within a `code block`.
2. Place any architecture diagrams or related images in the `images` folder in either (PNG, JPEG, or GIF) format
3. Add any reference material related to the saas pattern in the reference section at the bottom
